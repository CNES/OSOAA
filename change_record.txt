  The inc/OSOAA.h file is adapted concequently

- Changes of the OSOAA_AEROSOLS.F file : V1.1 --> V1.2
    * Adaptations for reading the file of defined angles
      (to enable a gfortran compilation - linux system)

- Changes of the OSOAA_ANGLES.F file : V1.1 --> V1.2
    * Minor adjustments of string lengths
    * Modification to avoid duplicating the angle 0 degree in the list of angles

- Changes of the OSOAA_HYDROSOLS.F file : V1.1 --> V1.2
    * Adaptations for reading the file of defined angles
      (to enable a gfortran compilation - linux system)
    * New log information : integration of the phase function over all 
      directions or only over backward directions
     
- Changes of the OSOAA_MAIN.F file : V1.1 --> V1.2
    * Major improvement of software performances: 
      Introduction of the capability to perform a new simulation 
      based on same bio-physical parameters but for different output 
      parameters (Phi, Z, ...) without recalculating the radiance field as a
      Fourier series expansion but by using that of a previous process.
    * Introduction of the possibility to not perform a radiative transfer  
      calculation if IGMAX = 0. In this case, only profiles and phase                           
      functions are calculated.
    * Introduction of a new file, called "Flux.txt":
       --> Profile of downwelling and upwelling flux from TOA 
           to the sea bottom normalised to the solar irradiance at TOA.
       
- Changes of the OSOAA_SOS.F file : V1.1 --> V1.2
    * Adaptations for reading the file of defined angles
      (to enable a gfortran compilation - linux system)
    * Introduction of the new output file "Flux.txt" 
    * Minor adjustement of the format of result files.
    
- Changes of the OSOAA_SOS_CORE.F file : V1.1 --> V1.2
    * Calculation of the flux profile (downwelling and upwelling)  
      from sea bottom to TOA, normalised to the solar irradiance at TOA 
      --> Results are written in the file "Advanced_outputs/Flux.txt" 
    
- Changes of the OSOAA_SURFACE.F file : V1.1 --> V1.2
    * Adaptations for reading the file of defined angles
      (to enable a gfortran compilation - linux system)    
    

  
OSOAA V1.4 : 2016, November 3rd
----------
- Changes of the OSOAA_PROFILE.F file : V1.1 --> V1.2
    * Improvement of the calculation for the number of layers NZ
      -> use of the NINT() function to avoid a potential truncation effect.

- Changes of the OSOAA_AEROSOLS.F file :  V1.2 --> V1.3
  Changes of the OSOAA_HYDROSOLS.F file : V1.2 --> V1.3
  Changes of the OSOAA_SURFACE.F file :   V1.2 --> V1.3
    Changes to be compliant with a f77 compilation:
    * CALL FLUSH() changed to CALL FLUSH(6)
    * Change a variable type to read the file including the list of angles for
      Mie or radiance computations

- Changes of the OSOAA_MAIN.F file : V1.2 --> V1.3
    * CALL FLUSH() changed to CALL FLUSH(6)
      (to enable a correct execution for a f77 compilation)

- Changes of the OSOAA_SOS.F file : V1.2 --> V1.3
    * Change a variable type to read the file including the list of angles for
      radiance computations 
      (to enable a correct execution for a f77 compilation)

- The option -w is added in the makefile gen/Makefile_OSOAA.f77 
  to avoid warning messages 


  
OSOAA V1.5 : 2018, August 7th
----------
- Changes of the src/OSOAA_MAIN.F file : V1.3 --> V1.4
    * Introduction of the calculation of the sea bottom reflectance in case of 
      use of tabulated data (case SEA.BotType = 2 to 5 : Light sand, Green algae, 
      Brown algae or Red algae).
    * Change of the writing format for the SEA.BotAlb parameter in the file 
      listing the process parameters.

- Changes of the src/OSOAA_PARTICLES_RAD.F file : V1.1 --> V1.2
    * In files of radiative properties of particles, the format to write the value 
      of mean refractive index is changed
      (to avoid non numerical values "***")

- Changes of the src/OSOAA_PROFILE.F file : V1.2 --> V1.3
    * Correction for the use of a profile of chlorophyll from the user.
    * Correction to avoid an anomaly for the reading of chlorophyll 
      absorption and scattering data in case of the use of a user's chlorophyll profile.

- Changes of the src/OSOAA_SOS.F file : V1.3 --> V1.4
    * Change of the global implementation for the polarization angle calculation.
      The case Q = U = 0 leads to undefined value (-999.00).
    * Unit for I, Q and U is added in result files.
    * Change of the text to mention the depth for the output results.

- Changes of the src/OSOAA_SOS_CORE.F file : V1.2 --> V1.3
    * Correction of anomalies for the calculation of the upward direct flux
      in the atmosphere provided in the Flux.txt file
      Note: Anomaly only in the Flux.txt file NOT in the radiative transfer calculation
            of I, Q and U Stokes parameters.
    * The ratio upward flux / downward flux (Eu/Ed) is added in the Flux.txt file (column nÂ°9)

- Changes of the inc/OSOAA.h file : V1.0 --> V1.1
    * New constants: CTE_FIC_BOT_SPECTRAL_DATA and CTE_NB_WA_FIC_BOT 

- Changes of the GUI :

   - Changes of the ihm/src/osoaa/usl/forms/AtmosphericAndSeaProfilesJPanel.java :
     * Clarification of the parameter -SEA.SurfAlb in the "Atmospheric and sea profiles" window
       (Foam lambertian reflectance for the  simulation wavelength).

   - Changes of the ihm/conf/hydrogroundModel.properties :
     * The GUI gives more consistent default values for the Slope of Junge's law 
       for phytoplankton particles and for mineral-like particles.
     * Set to 1 the ratio of the main mode in the global distribution 
       for phytoplankton particles and for mineral-like particles.

   - The OSOAAUI.jar is built and replaced in ihm/bin/. 

- The demonstration scripts exe/run_OSOAA.ksh (and *.csh) are removed 
  (because they included many unused input parameters).
  The script exe/run_OSOAA_demo.ksh is improved to be more realistic. 
  A note regarding the input parameters is provided in the demonstration script
  and an example of water leaving radiance simulation which does not account for foam is given.
  A csh version (run_OSOAA_demo.csh) is added.

- Changes of the User Manual : V1.1 --> V1.2
    * See the Change Record on page i.3
