OSOAA V1.0 : 2015, April 2nd
-----------
Initial OSOAA code


OSOAA V1.1 : 2015, June 16th
----------
- All comments for log files are now in english
- Changing the way of reading the formatted files (angles, ...)
  to be compatible with the compiler gfortran.

  
OSOAA V1.2 : 2015, June 24th
----------
- User Manual now available.
- GUI: minor syntax correction.

  
OSOAA V1.3 : 2016, October 21st
----------
- Correction of some aerosols data in files:
	fic/Data_SF 	replaced by 	fic/Data_SF_cor_2015_12_16 
	fic/Data_WMO 	replaced by 	fic/Data_WMO_cor_2015_12_16  
	fic/IRefrac_LU 	replaced by 	fic/IRefrac_LU_cor_2015_12_16
	fic/IRefrac_OM 	replaced by 	fic/IRefrac_OM_cor_2015_12_16
	fic/IRefrac_SR 	replaced by 	fic/IRefrac_SR_cor_2015_12_16
	fic/IRefrac_SU 	replaced by 	fic/IRefrac_SU_cor_2015_12_16

  The inc/OSOAA.h file is adapted concequently

- Changes of the OSOAA_AEROSOLS.F file : V1.1 --> V1.2
    * Adaptations for reading the file of defined angles
      (to enable a gfortran compilation - linux system)

- Changes of the OSOAA_ANGLES.F file : V1.1 --> V1.2
    * Minor adjustments of string lengths
    * Modification to avoid duplicating the angle 0 degree in the list of angles

- Changes of the OSOAA_HYDROSOLS.F file : V1.1 --> V1.2
    * Adaptations for reading the file of defined angles
      (to enable a gfortran compilation - linux system)
    * New log information : integration of the phase function over all 
      directions or only over backward directions
     
- Changes of the OSOAA_MAIN.F file : V1.1 --> V1.2
    * Major improvement of software performances: 
      Introduction of the capability to perform a new simulation 
      based on same bio-physical parameters but for different output 
      parameters (Phi, Z, ...) without recalculating the radiance field as a
      Fourier series expansion but by using that of a previous process.
    * Introduction of the possibility to not perform a radiative transfer  
      calculation if IGMAX = 0. In this case, only profiles and phase                           
      functions are calculated.
    * Introduction of a new file, called "Flux.txt":
       --> Profile of downwelling and upwelling flux from TOA 
           to the sea bottom normalised to the solar irradiance at TOA.
       
- Changes of the OSOAA_SOS.F file : V1.1 --> V1.2
    * Adaptations for reading the file of defined angles
      (to enable a gfortran compilation - linux system)
    * Introduction of the new output file "Flux.txt" 
    * Minor adjustement of the format of result files.
    
- Changes of the OSOAA_SOS_CORE.F file : V1.1 --> V1.2
    * Calculation of the flux profile (downwelling and upwelling)  
      from sea bottom to TOA, normalised to the solar irradiance at TOA 
      --> Results are written in the file "Advanced_outputs/Flux.txt" 
    
- Changes of the OSOAA_SURFACE.F file : V1.1 --> V1.2
    * Adaptations for reading the file of defined angles
      (to enable a gfortran compilation - linux system)    
    

  
OSOAA V1.4 : 2016, November 3rd
----------
- Changes of the OSOAA_PROFILE.F file : V1.1 --> V1.2
    * Improvement of the calculation for the number of layers NZ
      -> use of the NINT() function to avoid a potential truncation effect.

- Changes of the OSOAA_AEROSOLS.F file :  V1.2 --> V1.3
  Changes of the OSOAA_HYDROSOLS.F file : V1.2 --> V1.3
  Changes of the OSOAA_SURFACE.F file :   V1.2 --> V1.3
    Changes to be compliant with a f77 compilation:
    * CALL FLUSH() changed to CALL FLUSH(6)
    * Change a variable type to read the file including the list of angles for
      Mie or radiance computations

- Changes of the OSOAA_MAIN.F file : V1.2 --> V1.3
    * CALL FLUSH() changed to CALL FLUSH(6)
      (to enable a correct execution for a f77 compilation)

- Changes of the OSOAA_SOS.F file : V1.2 --> V1.3
    * Change a variable type to read the file including the list of angles for
      radiance computations 
      (to enable a correct execution for a f77 compilation)

- The option -w is added in the makefile gen/Makefile_OSOAA.f77 
  to avoid warning messages
